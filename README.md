# Lab 0

For this assignment, we are going to familiarize ourselves with our homework submission system, a technology used throughout the industry: Git!

## What is Git?

Git is a version-control system originally developed by Linus Torvalds in 2005. It allows a software developer to take "snapshots" of a project as it progresses. The tool enables a bunch of different features that streamline collaboration as well. Projects can be "forked" which allows other developers to copy the entire codebase and make their own edits and then submit it back to the creator for "merging" or just use it in their own way. You can "branch" your project which allows you to try experimental things to see if they work before committing them to your main branch.

There are a ton of interesting features that Git implements but we're basically just going to use it as a way of submitting homework and storing files for projects that can have several files.

## What is GitHub?

GitHub is an online implementation of Git owned (recently) by Microsoft. It sort of combines features of social networks with Git and cloud-storage solutions. We will be ignoring the vast majority of its many features and instead will be using a system called GitHub Classroom to fork individual repositories into your accounts. In fact, if you're reading this, you've probably already successfully done this!

## What do I need to do?

For this assignment, you will notice that there are two files: `README.md` and `intro.html`. You will clone this repository to your local machine and then open the `intro.html` file. Inside, you'll see the following code:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>ITECH 270</title>
</head>
<body>

    <h1>YOUR NAME GOES HERE</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
        TELL US A LITTLE BIT ABOUT YOURSELF.
    </p>
    
</body>
</html>
```

Simply replace the all-caps parts with your words. Just a couple sentences is totally fine for the biography part. And don't worry about formatting at all. Just make sure all of your words stay below the `<p>` and above the `</p>`. Don't worry about breaking it up into paragraphs or anything.

When you are finished, make sure you save that file and then "push" the repository back to GitHub. These processes will be explained, demonstrated, and drilled in class. So don't worry if you don't understand it yet.
